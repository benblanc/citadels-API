# Citadels

A python application which simulates the game called "Citadels".

This is a little project to test my python and flask skills.

The goal of the project is to create server to which 8 players can connect to play the game through a browser.

The repository contains both code for the client (player) and server. To play the game start the server first, then you can start the client.
